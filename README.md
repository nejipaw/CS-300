# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course:
for this course we were learning how to code programs using any of the given databases and to choose and explain why it was the most efficent one, 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand:
for this problem i knew what the program needed to do in order to be successful, the program needed to creat a list of all the courses and sort them as well as display any pre requisites for the course, and for this i thought the binary tree would be the quickest way to do so.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?:
most of the roadblocks i ran into i got through by using tutoring as well as googling in order to find out how a thing should be written and examples of way to sort the code as well as best practicies that way i understood every part of my code even better.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?:
this project helped me learn that there are many ways to create the same project and some are better than others and that it is important to understand the differences in these approaches as well as why we would choose which alogorithm we chose in order to make the program as fast and easy as possible

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable:
personally i thing this project helped me make my code more efficent rather than just throwing it together as well as helped me understand the deeper workings of my code and why i would do it a certain way
